# Python Bot to Find Graphics Cards #

It's really frustrating to try and find a graphics card these days sop I'm having
my comp sci degree to it for me. Should be a blend of python web scraping and some sort
of notification system to allow me to actually get the purchase in before anyone else.
Lots of people like to do the capcha stuff here and have the purchase automated too, but
thats a little to scummy for my taste, so I'm going to focus mainly on the finding and 
reporting of any and all graphics cards when they become available.


## Web Scraper ##

Probably some medley of beautiful soup and either utilizing inventory APIs or 
just full on webscraping any/all websites for any info on where/when to get them.


## Notficiation System ##

This part will be a bit more complex in that I have no idea what I want it to
look like. I'm not sure if I want it to text my phone or even go as far as to potentially
find a way to wake me up as a lot of these graphics cards become available as early as 6am
in the morning. This will be a complex task to outline and will be formulated better 
as the project goes on.


** Goal: **
Secure a graphics card for the love of god (rtx 3070, 3080, 3090 OR AMD 6700, 6800, 6800 XT)
